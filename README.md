# snakes-battle

Every player in the competition creates his version of of the ai-snake class.
The players need to implement the 'change_direction' function so their snake will be 'smart' enough to survive and win.

Some information about the game:

Game settings: 
1. We now need to specify the number of cells we want in the board. No need to mess with height, width or cell size.

2. You can press + or - keys to adjust the delay between frames.


Logic:
1. When a snake hits itself is cuts itself in the hitting point.

Fruits:
1. 'Strawberry' fruit makes the snake one unit longer.
2. 'Dragon Fruit' makes the snake two units longer.
3. 'Bomb' shrinks the snake in 2 units.
4. 'Shield' fruit protects the snake from getting hurt when eating a bomb. Snake with a shield can cross itself without cutting it body. Snake with a shield won't get hurt by Skull fruit. The shield protects the snake only once. 
5. 'Skull' kills the snake the eat it unless the snake is shielded.
6. 'King' It just looks cool. We can add a special power for a snake that is a king. Only one king in a game.
7. 'knife' gives the snake the power to cut other snakes. This power is limited for cutting only one snake.
