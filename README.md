# snakes-battle

Every player in the competition creates an AI snake.
The players need to implement the 'make_decision' function so their snake will be 'smart' enough to survive and win.

Every frame, the method make_decision is being called so every snake will have to choose where it should go in order to win.

Some information about the game:

Logic:
1. Snake that hits itself is out.
2. Snake hits a border is out.
3. Snake hits other snake is out.
4. When snakes collide head to head, they both will out of the game, unless one of them is a king, it will survive the collision.
5. Snake that caused an exception to raise, will be removed from game.
6. The winner is the snake with the highest score when the time is over or when there are no more snakes in the board.

Fruits:
1. 'Strawberry' - makes the snake one unit longer.
2. 'Dragon Fruit' - makes the snake two units longer.
3. 'Bomb' - shrinks the snake in 2 units.
4. 'Shield' -  protects the snake from getting hurt when eating a bomb. Snake with a shield can cross itself without cutting its body. Snake with a shield won't get hurt by Skull. The shield protects the snake only once.
5. 'Skull' -  kills the snake that eats it unless the snake is shielded.
6. 'King' - Snake moves and makes decision X2 from the other snakes. Every fruit snake eats, increases the snake in two units (even skull).
7. 'knife' - gives the snake the power to cut other snakes. This power is limited for cutting only one snake.
